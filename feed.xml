    Build almost from scratch, the Remedy Houdini-environment is the main way of interacting with Houdini at Remedy.<br>For most of its development I was the sole developer responsible for building and maintaining an environment that would allow for easy access to Houdini; management of HDAs (Houdini Digital Assets) on multiple projects; as well as making said HDAs easy to create and update.<br>Over the various iterations the "backend" went through, <br>the current version has three main components:<br>
  </p>

  <p>
    When the user clicks one of the shortcuts (Houdini core, FX, and Apprentice) the sequence shown above is triggered creating a scene where the user can use Houdini without worrying about the details.
  </p>

    <h6 id="2-io-tooling">

  <p>
    Getting files into and out of a DCC is one of the most important parts of a pipeline.<br>As such, the pipeline features a collection of nodes to roundtrip not just geometry files (namely FBX), but also proprietary metadata used in the Northlight engine.

    To give users easy access to all important operation, the decision was made to put them in plain sight. As such, all the important items like: creating, updating, or submitting a HDA are all in a single place alongside a collection of other common utility functions

  <p>
    Near the end of development on CrossfireX: Operation Spectre, it became clear it wouldn't be possible for the modelling department to populate the entire level with roofs. There was simply too much to do.
  </p>

  <p>
    The brief was simple: Create a tool that can quickly make roof&nbsp; geometry and make it work inside Maya using Houdini Engine.<br>Since the roofs were only visible from afar or from below, it was possible to use relatively simple geometry and focus on making the system quick, and easy to use.<br>
  </p>

  <p>
    Though making the tool work properly with Houdini engine in Maya was a real challenge, the final result helped speed up work on the level freeing up time for the artists to work on other parts of the project.<br>
  </p>

    <h2 id="using-the-tool-in-maya">
      Using the tool in Maya
    </h2>

  <p>
    To make the process of creating roofs as fast as possible, the process was made into a borderline one-click process.<br>Below you can see a demonstration of the three modes the tool operates on in Maya:
  </p>

    <h4 id="object-mode">
      Object mode
    </h4>

    <figure class="post__image post__image--center">
      <img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://jonne-g.github.io/portfolio/media/posts/7/roof_generator-making_off-object_selection.gif" height="450" width="800" alt="object selection inside Maya" />
      
    </figure>

    <h4 id="face-mode">
      Face mode
    </h4>

    <figure class="post__image post__image--center">
      <img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://jonne-g.github.io/portfolio/media/posts/7/roof_generator-making_off-face_selection-2.gif" height="450" width="800" alt="face selection in maya" />
      
    </figure>

    <h4 id="edge-mode">
      Edge mode
    </h4>

    <figure class="post__image post__image--center">
      <img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://jonne-g.github.io/portfolio/media/posts/7/roof_generator-making_off-edge_selection.gif" height="450" width="800" alt="edge selection in Maya" />
      
    </figure>

  <p>
    One interesting note on the edge-mode is the additions of gables.<br>This was one of the requirements: an easy way of adding gables to the roofs.<br>In Houdini, the tool used groups for this, and to translate this to Maya, I used edge selection instead.
  </p>

  <p>
    This "one-click" process is in part enabled by a maya shelf tool.<br>Once the user clicks this button a few things happen:
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li>In case of face- or edge-selection, the actual selection is stored<br>&nbsp;and the whole object is selected instead</li><li>If not already loaded, Houdini engine is enabled</li><li>The roof-generator Maya-version is placed in the scene<br>with the object selection as its target</li><li>In case of face- or edge-selection, an additional two parameters are populated:<br>An "id" parameter passing through the type of the selection (face or edge),<br>and the selection in a way Houdini can read it</li><li>Finally, the roof-generator HDA is triggered again using a deferred-loading call.<br>This call is deferred as sometimes the HDA is placed before Houdini engine is<br>actually loaded.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>
    Once this whole process is finished, the user will have a roof ready to export to game!
  </p>

    <h2 id="mayahda-wrapper">
      Maya-HDA wrapper
    </h2>

  <p>
    In the placement process above I mentioned a Maya-version of the HDA.<br>This is referring to a HDA wrapper made to have Maya usage of Houdini much easier.<br>The wrapper contains a section that allows for specifying different behaviour for each type of component selection in Maya as well as the parameters to accompany it.
  </p>

  <p>
    Of course it's not able to do all of this work alone, and on the Maya side it is paired with a python module that neatly wraps away the launching process mentioned above.<br>Because of this, anyone looking to launch a HDA in Maya, only needs a single function:<br>placeHda() or placeHdaWithSelection().<br>
  </p>

    <h2 id="stress-test">
      Stress test
    </h2>

  <p>
    Of course one of the fun parts of having a procedural system is stress testing!<br>Below is a looped animation of the roof-generator tackling a blend-shaped input.<br>As far as stability goes, I think it does pretty well!
  </p>

    <h2 id="looking-back-and-future-plans">
      Looking back and future plans
    </h2>

  <p>
    Making this tool was one hell of a ride. It was almost a perfect 50/50 split of making the tool, and making it work inside Maya. Using the tool again whilst recording the above videos made me realize it that was worth it.<br>Seeing all the buildings have roofs was quite the sight! <br>And in the end, it did its job: It helped ship the level and allowed the artists to spend more time on the fun stuff!
  </p>

  <p>
    As for plans for the future, I purposefully set up the tool in a very modular way.<br>When the opportunity/need arises, I would love to go back and add support for more roof types!<br>

  <p>
    &nbsp;The material-browser is an interface between the material-database on disk, and the user’s  scene. Its main adoption has been in maya, but it is made to be easily adapted to other applications supporting Qt (described in the code-overview below).
  </p>

  <p>
    Before the interface, the users had no easy way of importing materials into their scene without using an external application. Initially the material browser was only intended to import materials, but throughout development it also became the defacto tool for managing materials within the scene, and on objects (the scene- and selection tab).
  </p>

  <p>
    Making this interface was my first introduction to Qt and UI programming, and over the various iterations the browser went through, I learned a lot about the various quirks and features of Qt, and how to maintain large python applications.&nbsp;
  </p>

    <h2 id="architecture">
      Architecture
    </h2>

  <p>
    The material browser was my first venture into really using programming patterns.<br>In some of the early briefs, the material browser was not just intended to be used in Maya, but also in other DCCs. To achieve this, it needed a very strict separation of interaction logic and UI.
  </p>

  <p>
    A few iterations, the diagram below is what I settled on. Though it's most likely not the most optimal, it worked quite well for the browser in its current state.
  </p>

    <figure class="post__image post__image--center">
      <img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://jonne-g.github.io/portfolio/media/posts/6/material_browser_architecture-2.png" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://jonne-g.github.io/portfolio/media/posts/6/responsive/material_browser_architecture-2-xs.png 300w ,https://jonne-g.github.io/portfolio/media/posts/6/responsive/material_browser_architecture-2-sm.png 480w ,https://jonne-g.github.io/portfolio/media/posts/6/responsive/material_browser_architecture-2-md.png 768w ,https://jonne-g.github.io/portfolio/media/posts/6/responsive/material_browser_architecture-2-lg.png 1024w ,https://jonne-g.github.io/portfolio/media/posts/6/responsive/material_browser_architecture-2-xl.png 1360w ,https://jonne-g.github.io/portfolio/media/posts/6/responsive/material_browser_architecture-2-2xl.png 1600w"  height="1343" width="1001" alt="" />
      
    </figure>

  <p>
    In the diagram above you can see how the material browser is built.<br>Of these building blocks, the ui, controller and model are all completely clean of DCC or on-disk/database interaction code.&nbsp;<br>
  </p>

    <h2 id="looking-back-and-future-plans">
      Looking back and future plans
    </h2>

  <p>
    This tool is quite dear to me, it was among the first tasks I was assigned, and throughout the various iterations I made, it was essentially a benchmark for my coding skills. In its current version (v3) I'm quite happy with how it turned out.<br>
  </p>

  <p>
    The future development of this tool is an interesting one.<br>Initially, it was designed to be used as an asset-browser not just containing materials.<br>Additionally, the tool was set to be used in various DCCs, not just Maya.<br>Because of this, all underlying code was strictly written in "pure python" without any DCC-side code. All DCC logic was delegated to interaction modules as mentioned above. When I get back to this tool I'd love to realize this cross-DCC compatibility as I think it would be an interesting challenge.<br>
