Launching Houdini\n    </h6>\n\n  <p>\n    When the user clicks one of the shortcuts (Houdini core, FX, and Apprentice) a setup script is triggered with a project specific configuration file.<br>Said configuration file holds information about what python-modules to load; which version of Houdini to use; miscellaneous environment variables; and which HDAs to import. This startup script essentially sets up the environment.\n  </p>\n\n    <h6 id=\"2-importing-hdas\">\n      2. Importing HDAs\n    </h6>\n\n  <p>\n    The project HDAs are imported using a custom importation process.<br>A project can also define which HDAs are hidden or locked.<br>Here \"locking\" a HDA refers to limiting the version of an asset during loading.<br>This is feature is intended to be used on projects locking their codebase during the final shipping phase of the project. It is also the reason the Houdini-native package system wasn't used, it didn't support locking HDAs on a specific version.\n  </p>\n\n    <h6 id=\"3-hda-management\">\n      3. HDA Management\n    </h6>\n\n  <p>\n    The final component of the Remedy Houdini-environment isn't specifically a launch-specific process, rather its a set of tools for managing HDAs.<br>Its main purpose is to reduce/remove human error and give the users more time to do their work.<br>To achieve this, the management system automates HDA creation, versioning, and various perforce commands (shelve, submit, and in special cases, checkout).<br>The ease-of-use features are described in further detail below.\n  </p>",

There was simply too much to do.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    To address this issue, I was tasked with making a procedural solution that should integrate with Maya and make said roofs much easier to make.<br>Though making the tool work properly with Houdini engine in Maya was a real challenge, the final result helped speed up work on the level freeing up time for the artists to work on other parts of the project.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    This tool really showed me how much trouble integration can bring.<br>Out of all the time spent almost 40% was spend on making Houdini engine and Maya play together nicely. That said, it was also a great learning experience on what kind of problems you can run into with these kinds of tools, and what to expect ahead of time.<br>\n  </p>",
