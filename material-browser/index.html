Its main adoption has been in maya, but it is made to be easily adapted to other applications supporting Qt (described in the code-overview below).</p><p>Before the interface, the users had no easy way of importing materials into their scene without using an external application. Initially the material browser was only intended to import materials, but throughout development it also became the defacto tool for managing materials within the scene, and on objects (the scene- and selection tab).</p><p>Making this interface was my first introduction to Qt and UI programming, and over the various iterations the browser went through, I learned a lot about the various quirks and features of Qt, and how to maintain large python applications.&nbsp;</p><h2 id="architecture">Architecture</h2><p>The material browser was my first venture into really using programming patterns.<br>In some of the early briefs, the material browser was not just intended to be used in Maya, but also in other DCCs. To achieve this, it needed a very strict separation of interaction logic and UI.</p><p>A few iterations, the diagram below is what I settled on. Though it's most likely not the most optimal, it worked quite well for the browser in its current state.</p><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://jonne-g.github.io/portfolio/media/posts/6/material_browser_architecture-2.png" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://jonne-g.github.io/portfolio/media/posts/6/responsive/material_browser_architecture-2-xs.png 300w, https://jonne-g.github.io/portfolio/media/posts/6/responsive/material_browser_architecture-2-sm.png 480w, https://jonne-g.github.io/portfolio/media/posts/6/responsive/material_browser_architecture-2-md.png 768w, https://jonne-g.github.io/portfolio/media/posts/6/responsive/material_browser_architecture-2-lg.png 1024w, https://jonne-g.github.io/portfolio/media/posts/6/responsive/material_browser_architecture-2-xl.png 1360w, https://jonne-g.github.io/portfolio/media/posts/6/responsive/material_browser_architecture-2-2xl.png 1600w" height="1343" width="1001" alt=""></figure><p>In the diagram above you can see how the material browser is built.<br>Of these building blocks, the ui, controller and model are all completely clean of DCC or on-disk/database interaction code.&nbsp;<br></p><h2 id="looking-back-and-future-plans">Looking back and future plans</h2><p>This tool is quite dear to me, it was among the first tasks I was assigned, and throughout the various iterations I made, it was essentially a benchmark for my coding skills. In its current version (v3) I'm quite happy with how it turned out.<br></p><p>The future development of this tool is an interesting one.<br>Initially, it was designed to be used as an asset-browser not just containing materials.<br>Additionally, the tool was set to be used in various DCCs, not just Maya.<br>Because of this, all underlying code was strictly written in "pure python" without any DCC-side code. All DCC logic was delegated to interaction modules as mentioned above. When I get back to this tool I'd love to realize this cross-DCC compatibility as I think it would be an interesting challenge.<br></p></div></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__social"><a href="https://twitter.com/TechnicallyArt1" aria-label="Twitter"><svg><use xlink:href="https://jonne-g.github.io/portfolio/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#twitter"/></svg> </a><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jonne-geven/" aria-label="LinkedIn"><svg><use xlink:href="https://jonne-g.github.io/portfolio/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#linkedin"/></svg> </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwsdnWaddFCekGWf8omcYYg" aria-label="Youtube"><svg><use xlink:href="https://jonne-g.github.io/portfolio/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#youtube"/></svg></a></div><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Jonne Geven, Technical Artist</p></div><button onclick="backToTopFunction()" id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg><use xlink:href="https://jonne-g.github.io/portfolio/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = {
